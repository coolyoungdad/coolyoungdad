# Alexander's Github 🖥⌨️

Welcome to my Github where you'll find a variety of projects ranging from a full-stack web app [(Futreviews)](https://www.fut.reviews) to three.js learnings [(like this donut)](http://ab-donut.superhi.com/) to a bot that buys Supreme [(use at your own risk 😅)](https://github.com/coolyoungdad/preme-bot).

I'm self-taught software developer hoping to go pro soon.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include React, Node, and PostgreSQL. 

## Upcoming Roadmap

- Working with the NBA API 🏀
- Learning tone.js 🎶
- Building a raspberry pi midi controller 🍓
