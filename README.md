# Alexander's Github 🖥⌨️

Welcome to my Github where you'll find a variety of projects ranging from a full-stack web app [(Futreviews)](https://github.com/coolyoungdad/fifa-reviews) to three.js learnings [(like this donut)](https://github.com/coolyoungdad/donut) to a bot that buys Supreme [(use at your own risk 😅)](https://github.com/coolyoungdad/preme-bot).

I'm self-taught amateur software developer hoping to go pro soon :) 

Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, three.js, and SQLite. 

## Upcoming Roadmap

- Working with the NBA API 🏀
- Learning tone.js 🎶
- Building a raspberry pi midi controller 🍓
